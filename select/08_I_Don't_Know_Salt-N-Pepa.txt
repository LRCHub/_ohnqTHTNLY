Yo, Play, I never expected that from you
A guy's entitled to one mistake, Cheryl
One mistake? That ain't what I heard
(laughs) yo, what are you trying to say?
Look, let me kick it to you like this
It's not that I don't miss your kiss
Well what is it?
I'm scared of gettin' hurt
(what?) , much afraid
Of who? Me? Come on, baby
Don't try to play me it's true
But you know that I feel for you
Yeah, I do but
(what?) yo, Play, I can't trust you
Come on, why? How could you stand there with
A straight face and ask
I ain't the first or will not be the last
You got it all wrong
Those days they all gone
Yeah right, I ain't goin' out like a pawn
Come on
You make it sound like I'm a little ho
Yo, let me tell you somethin', buddy
I really don't know oh, I get it, now I see
I really don't know
After all the time you spent with me?
I really don't know
All the good things that we had in our mind
I really don't know
First I was sad now I'm gettin' mad
You gettin' mad? That's right, mad
What are you gettin' mad about?
Yo, you betteryo, girl

Look what I've done for you
You are ungrateful yo, Salt
I'm tellin' you lead that's
Goin' to your head
Look how youlook how you dissed me aw
Shut up
Now how could you forget so soon
All the nights with dim lights in the bedroom
The things we said, the things we did
All the talk about the house, the cars
And the kids yo, I'm not sayin' those
Things didn't happen but
That was before I found out you was a slut
Rappin' to all the girls in and out town
It didn't take long for word to get around
Yo, if you walk out on me, I'll understand
And have to take my lumps like a man
You see, nobody's perfect, neither are we
Love is knowin' when to say you're sorry
Yes, and I apologize
You sure that's not a lie?
Yeah, cross my heart and hope to die
Just let me know what is it with you men?
And don't tell me it's a Tom and Dick thing
Is it a must you lust for every big butt?
You realize it caused the end of us?
Ok, it's understood
The things I did it wasn't good
Now can we live our lives
Like normal couples should? M-m-m-m, no
No?! Well, I mean, I still don't know
It may be a mistake don't think it's fake
I poured my heart out
And you still don't believe me?
Well go ahead then
You might as well leave me
I think you're right, though
I know I'm right yeah, so?
So what?
Yo, I really don't know
Come on now, I ain't gonna beg

Didn't you hear a word I've said?
Yo, man, this ain't gonna work
Word, they're tryin' to play us
Like a bunch of jerks
Yo, I ain't gettin' on my knees for no one
